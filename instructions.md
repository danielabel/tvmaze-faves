The goal of this exercise is to produce a production ready, Single Page Application that allows you to find and display your favourite tv shows using the free and open API by tvmaze (http://www.tvmaze.com/api). We recommend React as we use it extensively at Signal, but feel free to use whatever you're comfortable with.

There are two files included (list-mockup.png and details-mockup.png) that show 2 states we'd like to have in the final application.

1) The first state allows you to search over tvshows. The results are shown in a 3 column poster layout that shows the poster, title and genres for each TV show.

2) The details view shows more metadata about the TV show, including description, cast and season information. Finally, it gives the option to star (locally persist) the TV show for viewing later.



Please submit your solution as a zip file.
